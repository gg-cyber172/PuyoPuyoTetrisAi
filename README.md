## About
   In this project we've created an adaptation of the games Puyo Puyo and Tetris and build a replayable AI Multiplayer platform through the use of Reinforcement Learning. In our program you are to play both alone in single player and against another user or Ai in multiplayer. We created an AI to play both games as efficiently as possible through reinforcement learning and specifically deep Q-learning.

This project was created in Python utilising open source libraries such as Pygame and Tensorflow. The program will be accessible through running an executable file on the userâ€™s computer. Along with this, the user will be able to interact with the interface using their mouse and control the games using their keyboard.

## Building the game
   A pre built executable of the the game can be found in the game directory inside the src directory. You do not need any of the dependencies to run that executuble. To build the executable yourself you'll need to have all of the dependencies listed below (Also found in the user manual) installed and then run the Buildgame Batch File in the src directory.

For a more detailed explanation please look to the User Manual in the docs directory.
